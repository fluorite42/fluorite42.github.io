Since the launch of the metric system in France in 1799, almost all countries around the world have finished metrication, and the International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system, became the most widly-used system of measurement.

There are few unit systems other than SI that are used officially today.
A notable case is the United States customary units.
Although the United Kingdom where the imperial system of units was developed has officially converted to the metric system, the United States still uses its own unit system derived from English units.
Because of the global influence of the United States and its dominant role in some fields such as aviation, displays, and computers, the United States customary units has become the second most important unit system in the world.

## 0. Imperial vs. US Customary Measurement Systems

Although Both imperial and US customary measurement systems are derived from the English units of measurement, there are noticeable differences between the two systems.
1. The *types* of units used in the two systems are different,
1. The *definitions* of each unit are different.

For example, a foot is 
- **0.3048 m** in imperial definition,
- **1200/3937 m** in US survey definition.

In everyday life, the difference between the two systems is negligible; however, as the scale increases, the difference becomes more pronounced.

In 1958, the US and Commonwealth countries standardized the units of length and weight in both systems based on the metric system.
The international standard says that a yard is 0.9144 m and a pound is 0.453 592 37 kg.
Though the US customary and international pounds are identical, the two yards are different, and both definitions are mixed in the United States.
In order to avoid confusion, the US survey length units are deprecated from January 2023 by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and this post follows the international length units.

Unless otherwise noted, all other units are described based on the United States customary units.

## 1. Length

## 5. Temperature

Degrees Fahrenheit are used in the US, the Freely Associated States (the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau), and the Cayman Islands.

The reference point of the Fahrenheit scale is the temperature of a mixture of ice, water, and ammonium chloride, and was built based on the Rømer scale.
Today, the Fahrenheit scale is established using two reference points spaced 180 degrees apart: water’s freezing temperature is set at 32 °F, while its boiling temperature is set at 212 °F.

**0 °F** and **100 °F** correspond to **-17.8 °C** and **37.8 °C**, respectively, and the temperature range of daily life mostly falls in between.

| °F | °C | Remarks |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | -17.8 | The coldest winter day |
| 32 | 0 | Freezing point |
| 50 | 10 | Midpoint; cool weather |
| 98.6 | 37 | Body temperature |
| 100 | 37.8 | The hottest summer day |

The conversion formula from Celsius to Fahrenheit is:

$$
\{T\}_{^{\circ}F} = \frac{9}{5}\{T\}_{^{\circ}C} + 32
$$



## Questions and Answers

1. Why hasn’t the United States fully adopted the metric system?
  - After the Revolutionary War in the late 18th century, the US attempted to adopt the metric system from France, but was thwarted. At the time, the US Congress showed little interest in standardizing measurement systems and continued using the imperial units already in use. Today, customary units are officially used throughout the United States, with the exception of Louisiana.

2. Will the United States ever be metricized?
  - When pigs fly.
