This post is about qubits, the fundamental operations we can perform on them, and how these operations give rise to powerful algebraic structures. 
We'll explore the Pauli matrices, the Pauli group, and the Clifford group, which play a central role in everything from quantum algorithms to error correction.


## Qubit States and the Pauli Matrices

In classical computing the fundamental unit is the **bit** (0 or 1). In quantum computing it’s the **qubit**. A qubit can be in the state \( |0\rangle \), \( |1\rangle \), or any **superposition** \( \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle \) with \(|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1\). We represent the computational basis states as vectors:

$$
|0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
|1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Quantum operations (**gates**) are matrices that act on these vectors. The most fundamental are the **Pauli matrices**:

* **Identity (I):** the “do nothing” gate  
  $$
  I = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
  $$

* **Pauli-X (X):** a quantum NOT (bit-flip)  
  $$
  X = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  $$

* **Pauli-Z (Z):** flips the phase of \(|1\rangle\) (phase-flip)  
  $$
  Z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
  $$

* **Pauli-Y (Y):** combines a bit-flip and a phase-flip  
  $$
  Y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}
  $$

Each Pauli is both **Hermitian** (\(A = A^\dagger\)) and **Unitary** (\(AA^\dagger = I\)), hence \(A^2 = I\). Their eigenvalues are \(\pm1\). They also **anticommute** (\(XY = -YX\), etc.) and satisfy:

$$
XY = iZ, \quad YZ = iX, \quad ZX = iY \quad \Rightarrow \quad XYZ = iI
$$


## The Pauli Group (\(P_1\))

Including physically irrelevant **global phases** \(\{\pm1, \pm i\}\), the single-qubit Pauli group is:

$$
P_1 = \{\pm I, \pm iI, \pm X, \pm iX, \pm Y, \pm iY, \pm Z, \pm iZ\}
$$

This gives 16 elements in total. In quantum error correction, \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) (up to global phase) form a convenient **error basis**: any single-qubit error channel can be decomposed into this set.


## Key Single-Qubit Gates

### Hadamard (H)

The Hadamard gate creates and rotates superpositions:

$$
H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

It acts as:
* \(H|0\rangle = |+\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+|1\rangle)\)
* \(H|1\rangle = |-\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle-|1\rangle)\)

Applying it twice returns the qubit to its original state: \(H^2 = I\).

### Phase (S)

The Phase gate adds a relative phase of \(i\) to \(|1\rangle\). It is the “square root” of \(Z\):

$$
S = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & i \end{pmatrix}, \quad S^2 = Z
$$


## The Clifford Group: Symmetries of the Paulis

The (single-qubit) **Clifford group** \(C_1\) is the **normalizer** of \(P_1\). A gate \(V\) is Clifford if:

$$
V P V^\dagger \in P_1 \quad \text{for all } P \in P_1
$$

In other words, Clifford gates permute Pauli operators (up to phase).

Examples:

* **Hadamard (H):** swaps \(X\) and \(Z\)
  $$
  H X H^\dagger = Z, \quad H Z H^\dagger = X
  $$

* **Phase (S):** rotates \(X\) into \(Y\), leaves \(Z\) unchanged
  $$
  S X S^\dagger = Y, \quad S Z S^\dagger = Z
  $$

Circuits built from Clifford gates (H, S, and multi-qubit Clifford gates like CNOT) can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer (the **Gottesman–Knill theorem**). To achieve **universal quantum computation**, at least one **non-Clifford** gate is required (e.g. the \(T\) gate, \(\text{diag}(1, e^{i\pi/4})\)).


## Extending to Multiple Qubits: The CNOT Gate

To generate **entanglement**, we need gates acting on more than one qubit. The most common is the **Controlled-NOT (CNOT)** gate. It flips the **target** qubit iff the **control** qubit is \(|1\rangle\). In the ordered basis \(|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle, |11\rangle\):

$$
CX = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

CNOT is also Clifford. Conjugation shows how Pauli errors propagate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
CX\,(X \otimes I)\,CX^\dagger &= X \otimes X \\
CX\,(I \otimes X)\,CX^\dagger &= I \otimes X \\
CX\,(Z \otimes I)\,CX^\dagger &= Z \otimes I \\
CX\,(I \otimes Z)\,CX^\dagger &= Z \otimes Z
\end{aligned}
$$

These relations are central to quantum error correction.
