<div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
    In quantum computing, mapping logical qubits to physical hardware and routing gates to satisfy connectivity constraints are critical compilation steps. 
    IBM’s heavy-hex architecture, widely used in current quantum processors, imposes unique topological challenges due to its irregular qubit connectivity. 
    While SABRE remains a dominant routing algorithm, its exhaustive SWAP evaluation incurs significant overhead as circuit sizes scale. 
    In this work, we introduce a tree-based pre-layout pass that embeds logical qubits into the coupling graph through a balanced, interaction-aware tree. 
    The resulting initial mapping enhances locality, pruning SABRE’s search space without altering its proven heuristics and cost model. 
    Experiments on random circuits and small-scale quantumerror-correction subcircuits compiled for heavy-hex backends circuit-depth reductions of as much as 13% compared with the original SABRE pipeline, affirming that a lightweight, topology-conscious initial mapping alone can yield substantial end-to-end benefits for near-term quantum devices.
